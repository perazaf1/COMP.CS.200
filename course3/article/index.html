                <h2>Summary of the Article</h2>
                <p>The article "Common Web Design Mistakes to Avoid" on wparena.com outlines several frequently
                    encountered errors that can negatively impact a website's user experience, accessibility, and
                    overall effectiveness. These mistakes range from issues with navigation and usability to problems
                    with design elements and content presentation. Key points highlighted include avoiding clutter,
                    ensuring mobile responsiveness, optimizing for speed, using appropriate typography and color
                    palettes, implementing clear calls to action, and prioritizing accessibility for all users. The
                    article highlights the importance of user-centered design principles and provides practical tips for
                    avoiding these incidents and creating a more engaging and effective website. All the tips are really
                    helpful, for both beginners or intermediate or avdanced software developpers. When we read the
                    article, it might seems logic, but in reality these kind of "rules" we need to follow them when
                    coding and designing our website to avoid the user frustration. </p>

                <h2>What I Learned</h2>
                <p>Reading this article really opened my eyes to how even the smallest design choices can significantly
                    impact user experience. I realized that it's crucial to consider mobile users right from the start
                    of a project, rather than treating them as an afterthought. The tips on website speed, especially
                    optimizing images and videos, were a game-changer for me since I often overlook these aspects during
                    the initial design phase.

                    I also learned how poor contrast and unreadable fonts can severely affect accessibility, which
                    reinforced the importance of inclusive design practices. Additionally, the article highlighted the
                    need for clear calls to action that effectively guide users through the website.

                    From the article on common web design mistakes, I picked up a few more valuable lessons. For
                    instance, neglecting mobile responsiveness is a major pitfall. Ensuring that a website is
                    mobile-friendly can greatly enhance user engagement and satisfaction. Another key point was the
                    impact of slow page load times. Optimizing website speed not only improves user experience but also
                    boosts search engine rankings (optimize SEO with useful tools). Lastly, the importance of intuitive
                    navigation and avoiding cluttered designs was highlighted, as these factors can make or break a
                    user's interaction with a site.</p>

                <h2>Why this article was benefical</h2>
                <p>This article was particularly meaningful and beneficial because it provided a concise and practical
                    overview of common web design mistakes, specifically aimed at preventing them. Many of the points
                    discussed were things I was not so aware of, but the article clearly articulated the reasons
                    <i>why</i> these practices should be avoided and offered specific solutions. For example, instead of
                    simply saying "optimize for phones," it explained the impact of responsiveness and how much users do uses their mobile phone to go on the internet, so that is why this is so important to look for the compatibility and the responsiveness. The article also served as a valuable checklist to keep
                    in mind when planning and executing future web design projects. It reinforced the importance in my mind of
                    putting the user first and constantly testing and iterating to improve the overall website
                    experience. This is also some tips that I have encountered in my course <i> HTI.100 </i>, which was about human-centered design and all the guidelines that make user not frustrated. By addressing these common mistakes, I will be able to create more effective and user-friendly
                    websites that achieve their intended goals.</p>
